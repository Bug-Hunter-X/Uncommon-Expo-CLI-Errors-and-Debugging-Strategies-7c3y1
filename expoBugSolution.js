The solution depends on the specific error encountered.  Generally, troubleshooting involves:

1. **Checking the Expo CLI logs:** The logs are essential for pinpointing the error's source.
2. **Verifying package.json:** Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and versions are compatible.  Use `npm install` or `yarn install` to reinstall.
3. **Examining app.json:**  Ensure the `app.json` file is properly configured.  Check for typos or incorrect settings.
4. **Inspecting project structure:** Verify the file structure conforms to Expo's standards.  Look for missing folders or incorrect placement of files.
5. **Cleaning the cache:** Sometimes, clearing the cache can resolve issues: `expo start --clear`
6. **Reinstalling dependencies:** Try reinstalling all packages using `npm install` or `yarn install`. 
7. **Creating a new project:** As a last resort, create a fresh Expo project and move your code over to rule out any existing project corruption.
