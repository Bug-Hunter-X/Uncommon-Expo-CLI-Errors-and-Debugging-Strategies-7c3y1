This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage an Expo project.  The error message might not be explicit, but the core problem is usually related to incorrect project setup, particularly issues with package.json, app.json, or the underlying file structure. This can manifest in various ways: build failures, start failures, or even unexpected behavior during development.  Debugging often involves checking the Expo CLI logs for more details, verifying the versions of dependencies, and ensuring the project structure conforms to Expo's conventions.
